# My collection of `Linux/bash` scripts

A collection of some useful `Linux/bash` scripts that I use on a regular basis for doing different things.

## List of scripts
Here is a alphabetically ordered list of the scripts:
- `clean-trailing-spaces.sh`: this script removes the trailing spaces of a list of given files passed as arguments. Moreover, with option `-b` it also creates a backup of the original file. Example: `clean-trailing-spaces.sh -b file1.txt file2.java`.
- `launch-aibench.sh`: this script starts an [AIBench](http://www.aibench.org/), with options (`-c/--compile` or `-cc/--clean-compile`) to build it before.
